# TOP_CSS_Project

This is my website for TOP's css end project ! 
This is my first attempt to design a website landing page, so I decided to create something that could be used as a portfolio template. I tried to include a lot of features additionnaly to TOP's initial demands, such as a "Go back to top" button designed in an arrow with CSS and not using any icon, or animations as well.
